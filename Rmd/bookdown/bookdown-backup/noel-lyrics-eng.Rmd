# Deck the Halls
```
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

  Don we now our gay apparel
  Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la.
  Troll the ancient Yule-tide carol
  Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.
```


# Jingle Bells  
```
Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Over fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob tails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight

  Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
  Jingle all the way
  Oh, what fun it is to ride
  In a one horse open sleigh 
  (x2)
```
##  Christmas Tree 
```
O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree
Your leaves are so unchanging (x2)

  Not only green when Summer’s here
  But also when it’s cold and drear
  O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree
  Your leaves are so unchanging
```


# We wish you a Merry Christmas 
```
We wish you a Merry Christmas (x3)
And a Happy New Year

  Good tidings we bring
  To you and your kin
  We wish you a Merry Christmas
  And a Happy New Year

Now bring us some figgy pudding (x3)
And a cup of good cheer
```



# Santa Claus is Coming to Town
```
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town

  He sees you when you're sleepin'
  He knows when you're a wake
  He knows if you've been bad or good
  So be good for goodness sake
```




## Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
```
Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer 
Had a very shiny nose, 
And if you ever saw it, 
You would even say it glows. 

All of the other reindeer 
Used to laugh and call him names; 
They never let poor Rudolph 
Join in any reindeer games.

  Then one foggy Christmas Eve, 
  Santa came to say, 
  Rudolph with your nose so bright, 
  Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
  
All of the reindeer loved him,
And they shouted out with glee
Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer
You’ll go down in History! X2
```


## Let it snow
```
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Man it doesn't show signs of stoppin'
And I brought some corn for poppin'
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

  When we finally kiss goodnight
  How I’ll hate going out in the storm
  And if you only hold me tight,
  All the way home I’ll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And my dear we're still goodbye-ing
As long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
```


# Jingle Bell Rock

```
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

  What a bright time, it's the right time
  To rock the night away
  Jingle bell time is a swell time
  To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
  
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell rock

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

  What a bright time, it's the right time
  To rock the night away (rock the night away)
  Jingle bell time is a swell time
  To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
  
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell (rock)
```



## Silent night 
```
Silent night, holy night! 
All is calm, all is bright. 
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child. 
Holy infant so tender and mild, 
Sleep in heavenly peace, 
Sleep in heavenly peace. 

Silent night, holy night! 
Shepherds quake at the sight. 
Glories stream from heaven afar 
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia, 
Christ the Savior is born! 
Christ the Savior is born. 

Silent night, holy night! 
Son of God love's pure light. 
Radiant beams from Thy holy face 
With dawn of redeeming grace, 
Jesus Lord, at Thy birth. 
Jesus Lord, at Thy birth.

# Walking in a winter wonderland 
```
Sleigh bells ring
Are you listening
In the lane
Snow is glistening
A beautiful sight,
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

  In the meadow we can build a snowman
  nd pretend that he is Parson Brown
  He'll say are you married, We'll say no man
  But you can do the job When you're in town
  
Later on
We'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
```


# Frosty the Snowman 
```
Frosty the Snowman, Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And his eyes made out of coal

Frosty the Snowman, Made the children laugh and play
And were they surprised when
Before their eyes
He came to life that day

  There must have been some magic
  In that old silk hat they found
  For when they placed it on his head
  He began to dance around

Frosty the Snowman, Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the Snowman, Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run
And we'll have fun
Now before I melt away

So down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led… 
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop

Frosty the Snowman, Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry
I'll be back again some day
Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow
```

## Sleigh Ride
```
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring ting tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you,
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling "Yoo hoo,"
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

  Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, let's go, Let's look at the show,
  We're riding in a wonderland of snow.
  Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up,it's grand, Just holding your hand,
  We're gliding along with a song of a wintry fairy land.

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
and comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
and sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
for a sleigh ride together with you.

    There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray
    It'll be the perfect ending a perfect day
    We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop,
    At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop. Pop! pop! pop!
    
    There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy,
    When they pass around the chocolate and the pumpkin pie
    It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
    These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives!

## Drummer Boy

Pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring
Pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the King
Pa rum pum pum pum
Ra pum pum pum

And they only spare heat 'cause I'm playing for the sun
Playing for the King, playing for the title
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible
I'm so tight I might go psycho

I'm so bad like Michael I know
I'm still young but I go I go
Stupid, stupid, love like cupid

I am a poor boy too
Pa rum pum pum pum (gather round the mistletoe real quick)…

# I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus" 

```
Wow, mommy's kissing Santa Claus
I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom, fast asleep

Then I saw mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

He saw mommy kissing, kissin', kissin' Santa Claus
I did, I really did see mommy kissing Santa Claus
And I'm gonna tell my dad



Then I saw mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

I did, I did, I really did see mommy kissing Santa Claus
You gotta believe me, you just gotta believe me
Come on, fellas, believe me, you just gotta believe me

## Angels We've Heard On (In Excelsis Deo)
```
ENGLISH: 
Angels we have heard on high,
Singing sweetly through the night,
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their brave delight.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.

Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why these songs of happy cheer?
What great brightness did you see?
What glad tiding did you hear?
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.

Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ, the Lord, the new-born King.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.

See him in a manger laid
Whom the angels praise above;
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
While we raise our hearts in love.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
Gloria in excelsis Deo.
